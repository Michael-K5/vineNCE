Description: Scripts for simulating from and evaluating the likelihood of non-simplified vines
    can be found in the R script simulate_non_simplified_vine.R.
    The script plotting methods contains methods for plotting the data,
    among others a function which performs a pair plot of copula data using ggplot2.
    Classifier Methods contains the functions for performing noise contrastive estimation
    with a simplified vine as noise distribution and neural network as correction factors.
